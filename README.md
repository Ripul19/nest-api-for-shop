## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Steps

Developed an api on products to do the CRUD operation
Implemented mysql database
added the JWT token

To run this 
1. Clone the repo to your system
2. setup your database locally and put it's credentials and database name and other info which need to change in database.module.ts file in the src/config folder
3. Change the jwt token secret which is in the jwt.config.ts file present in the src/config folder
4. You are ready to run the project.
5. Database handling is done through Sequelize, no need to change the queries

6. run command npm run start:dev

  POST Request
7. Go to Postman and send a post request to the link localhost:3000/products
    Request Body: {"title": "", "description": "", "price": ""}
    
  GET Request
8. now, send a Get request to the same link and you can get the product added to terminal

9. Similarly you can add more products through POST request

  GET Request
10. To fetch single product, send a get request to localhost:3000/products/:id,
  where :id will be replaced by the id of the product you want to fetch

  PATCH Request
11. Update operation can be performed by sending a Patch request to localhost:3000/products/:id,
  where :id will be replaced by the id of the product you want to fetch
  Request Body: {"title": "", "description": "", "price": ""}
  You can send only one or two fields also, no need to send all the three fields

  DELETE Request
12. Delete operation can be performed by sending a delete request to localhost:3000/products/:id,
  where :id will be replaced by the id of the product you want to fetch



Imporvements that can be done
1. Env file needs to set up
2. JWT token can be added to env file
3. Docker containerization 

These will help to make a less hardcode app
